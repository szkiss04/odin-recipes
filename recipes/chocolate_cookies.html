    <h1>Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookies</h1>
    <p>
        Ingredients
        ¾ cup brown sugar
        ½ cup unsalted butter, at room temperature
        ½ cup white sugar
        1 teaspoon salt
        1 large eggűs
        1 teaspoon vanilla extract
        1 ½ cups all-purpose flour
        ¾ teaspoon baking soda
        1 cup milk chocolate chips
        1 (3 ounce) bar dark chocolate, cut into chunks
        3 tablespoons white chocolate chips

        Directions
        Step 1
        Combine brown sugar, butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl; beat with an electric mixer until a creamy,
        deep brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.

        Step 2
        Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl. Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly
        incorporated, but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate, dark chocolate, and white chocolate
        using a spatula, not the mixer. Cover the dough and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.

        Step 3
        Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.

        Step 4
        Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce portions and place on a cookie sheet.

        Step 5
        Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not
        overbake; the centers will not look fully done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.
