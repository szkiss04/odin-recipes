        and color one-third pink and flavor with raspberry flavoring; color
        one-third yellow and flavor with lemon flavoring; color one-third pale
        blue and flavor with vanilla. Fill and make sandwich cookies with

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
Å±
    <!-- LIST OF INGREDIENTS GOES BELOW -->

    <ul>
        <li>3 egg whites</li>
        <li>6 tablespoons superfine (castor) sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup finely ground almonds</li>
        <li>1 1/2 teaspoons finely ground almonds</li>
        <li>1 1/3 cups confectioners' sugar</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <!-- LIST OF STEPS GOES BELOW -->

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Line baking sheets
            with parchment paper or a silicon mat.
        </li>
        <li>
            Whisk egg whites in a clean metal mixing bowl until thick, about
            5 minutes; whisk the superfine sugar into the egg whites until
            thick, glossy, and the mixture holds stiff peaks, 5 to 8 more
            minutes. Place a sieve over the bowl containing egg whites and
            sieve both amounts of almond meal and confectioners' sugar into the
            egg white mixture. Gently fold the almond meal and confectioners'
            sugar into the egg whites, retaining as much air as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
            Separate the meringue into separate bowls to flavor and color, if
            desired. Spoon the meringue into a piping bag fitted with a
            3/8-inch tip. Pipe 1-inch disks of meringue onto the prepared
            baking sheets, leaving about 2 inches between cookies.
        </li>
        <li>
            Let the cookies stand at room temperature for about 15 minutes to
            form a thin skin. Pick up the baking sheets and let drop from
            several inches above the work surface to adhere cookies to the
            baking sheets.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake in the preheated oven until tops are dry, about 15 minutes;
            let cool completely on the baking sheets before peeling off the
            parchment paper.
        </li>
    </ol>
