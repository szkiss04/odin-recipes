    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <!-- LIST OF INGREDIENTS GOES BELOW -->

    <ul>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>4 eggs</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cups white sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <!-- LIST OF STEPS GOES BELOW -->

    <ol>
        <li>
            Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
        </li>
        <li>
            In a medium bowl, blend together softened butter, 2 cups flour and
            1/2 cup sugar. Press into the bottom of an ungreased 9x13 inch pan.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and
            golden. In another bowl, whisk together the remaining 1 1/2 cups
            sugar and 1/4 cup flour. Whisk in the eggs and lemon juice. Pour
            over the baked crust.
        </li>
        <li>
            Bake for an additional 20 minutes in the preheated oven. The bars
            will firm up as they cool. For a festive tray, make another pan
            using limes instead of lemons and adding a drop of green food
            coloring to give a very pale green. After both pans have cooled,
            cut into uniform 2 inch squares and arrange in a checker board
            fashion.
        </li>
    </ol>
